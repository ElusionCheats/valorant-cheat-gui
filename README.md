Welcome to the **Valorant Cheat Menu**, a fully simulated cheat-style interface designed for developers, cybersecurity researchers, and modders. This project mimics the appearance and behavior of common **Valorant cheat menus** — including **Aimbot, ESP, Wallhack, TriggerBot, No Recoil**, and **Radar Hack** — without implementing any actual cheat functionality.

> ⚠️ **Disclaimer**: This is a non-functional **simulated UI**. It does not modify game memory, bypass anti-cheat, or perform real-time in-game actions. It is strictly for educational, UI prototyping, and anti-cheat research purposes.

## 🎯 Valorant Cheat Features

### Aimbot (Visual Toggle Only)
A classic cheat UI element that simulates an aim-assist system. While non-functional, it demonstrates typical options such as aim smoothing, FOV targeting, and bone selection.

### ESP (Extrasensory Perception)
Shows how enemy player outlines, health bars, and distance tags would appear on-screen. Useful for learning how overlays are represented and debugged.

### Wallhack
Fake rendering through surfaces mimicking real cheat visuals. Understand how enemy models and objects might be highlighted behind walls in actual cheat UIs.

### TriggerBot
Simulates automatic firing when the crosshair hovers over an enemy. Includes fake delay and toggle logic seen in many real-world cheat trainers.

### No Recoil
A UI switch that "removes" weapon recoil on paper. It’s only cosmetic here, but serves as a demonstration of how recoil modifiers are visually toggled in cheats.

### Radar Hack
Adds a mock mini-map radar with simulated player positions. Useful for developers looking to recreate or study radar injection visuals.
